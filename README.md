# Figma Plugin DS Svelte

This is a version of the Figma Plugin DS specifically for use in creating Figma Plugins. I decided to create this because Svelte seems like a great lightweight approach well suited for creating Figma plugins, and also simplifies the developer experience over using the vanilla JS Figma Plugin DS that I created with easier markup.

A Figma Plugin Svelte boilerplate is in the works.

## Installation

To install:
`npm -D figma-plugin-ds-svelte`
